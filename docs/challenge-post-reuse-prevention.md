# Challenge Post Reuse Prevention

## Overview

Added error handling to prevent users from submitting the same post to multiple challenges.

## Changes Made

### 1. ChallengeService.js

- **Method**: `submitPostToChallenge()`
- **Enhancement**: Added validation to check if a post has already been submitted to any other challenge
- **Error Message**: "This post has already been submitted to another challenge and cannot be reused"

### 2. ChallengePostService.js

- **New Method**: `findByPostId(postId)`
- **Purpose**: Check if a post is already submitted to any challenge

### 3. ChallengePostRepository.js

- **New Method**: `findByPostId(postId)`
- **Purpose**: Database query to find challenge submission by post ID
- **Returns**: Challenge post with challenge details if found, null otherwise

## Validation Flow

When a user tries to submit a post to a challenge:

1. **Check if challenge exists and is active**
2. **Check if user owns the post**
3. **Check if user already submitted to this challenge** ✓ (existing)
4. **Check if post is already submitted to this challenge** ✓ (existing)
5. **NEW: Check if post is already submitted to ANY other challenge** ✅ (new)

## Error Scenarios

| Scenario                                 | HTTP Status | Error Message                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Post not found                           | 404         | "Post not found or unauthorized"                                                     |
| User already submitted to this challenge | 400         | "You have already submitted to this challenge"                                       |
| Post already in this challenge           | 400         | "This post is already submitted to this challenge"                                   |
| **Post already in another challenge**    | **400**     | **"This post has already been submitted to another challenge and cannot be reused"** |

## API Endpoint

```
POST /api/challenges/:id/submit-post
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "postId": 123
}
```

### Error Response (Post Reuse)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "This post has already been submitted to another challenge and cannot be reused"
}
```

## Test File

Created `test-challenge-post-reuse.js` to verify the error handling works correctly.

### Usage

```bash
node test-challenge-post-reuse.js
```

## Business Logic

This prevents:

- ✅ Users from gaming the system by submitting the same popular post to multiple challenges
- ✅ Unfair advantage in multiple challenges
- ✅ Duplicate content across different challenges

This ensures:

- ✅ Each post can only participate in one challenge
- ✅ Fair competition in challenges
- ✅ Unique content for each challenge
