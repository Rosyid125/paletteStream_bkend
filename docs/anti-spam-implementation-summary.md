- ✅ Manual user unlock capability
- ✅ Spam history viewing
- ✅ Manual cleanup triggers

### 5. **Logging & Monitoring**

- ✅ `AntiSpamLogger` - Comprehensive logging system
- ✅ File-based logging (`logs/anti-spam.log`)
- ✅ Real-time log viewing via API
- ✅ Statistical analysis from logs
- ✅ Error tracking and debugging

### 6. **Automated Maintenance**

- ✅ `AntiSpamScheduler` - Daily cleanup scheduler
- ✅ Expired lock cleanup
- ✅ Old tracking data cleanup
- ✅ Automatic system maintenance

### 7. **User Notifications**

- ✅ Spam detection notifications
- ✅ Lock status notifications
- ✅ Integration with existing notification system

### 8. **Testing Suite**

- ✅ Basic test script (`test-anti-spam-system.js`)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (`test-comprehensive-anti-spam.js`)
- ✅ Setup and management script (`setup-anti-spam.js`)

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### Spam Thresholds

```javascript
COMMENT_SPAM: {
  MAX_SAME_COMMENTS: 5,        // Duplicate comment threshold
  TIME_WINDOW_MINUTES: 10,     // Time window for duplicate detection
  RAPID_COMMENT_LIMIT: 3,      // Rapid comment threshold
  RAPID_TIME_WINDOW: 5,        // Rapid time window (minutes)
  LOCK_DURATION_HOURS: 24      // Lock duration
}
```

### Modified Files:

1. `services/GamificationService.js` - Added anti-spam integration

5. `routes/api.js` - Added admin routes

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Setup system
node setup-anti-spam.js

# Run comprehensive tests
node test-comprehensive-anti-spam.js

# View statistics
node setup-anti-spam.js --stats

# Manual cleanup
node setup-anti-spam.js --cleanup
```

## 📊 API Endpoints

### Admin Endpoints (`/api/admin/spam/`):

- `GET /statistics` - Spam statistics
- `GET /locks` - Active locks
- `GET /user/:id/status` - User lock status
- `GET /user/:id/history` - User spam history
- `POST /user/:id/unlock` - Manual unlock
- `POST /cleanup` - Manual cleanup
- `GET /logs` - Recent logs
- `GET /logs/stats` - Log statistics

## 🔍 How It Works

### Normal Flow:

1. User creates comment
2. System checks for spam patterns
3. If clean: Comment saved + EXP given
4. If spam: Comment saved + User locked + No EXP

### Spam Detection:

1. Track all comments in `comment_spam_tracking`
2. Check duplicate content using MD5 hash
3. Check rapid commenting patterns
4. If threshold exceeded: Create lock in `user_spam_locks`
5. Block EXP for future comments
6. Send notification to user
7. Log incident for admin review

### Admin Management:

1. View real-time statistics
2. Monitor user activity
3. Manual unlock if needed
4. Review spam patterns
5. System maintenance

## 🛠️ Maintenance

### Daily Automated:

- Cleanup expired locks (2:00 AM)
- Remove old tracking data (30+ days)
- System health checks

### Manual:

- Review spam statistics
- Adjust thresholds if needed
- Monitor system performance
- Handle user appeals

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Fair Play**: Prevents EXP farming through comment spam
2. **User Experience**: Legitimate users unaffected
3. **Admin Control**: Full visibility and management tools
4. **Scalable**: Can extend to other spam types
5. **Maintainable**: Clean architecture following MVC-SR
6. **Monitorable**: Comprehensive logging and statistics
7. **Flexible**: Configurable thresholds and rules

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

The system is designed to be extensible. Potential future additions:

- Machine learning-based detection
- IP-based rate limiting
- Multiple spam type support (likes, follows, etc.)
- Dynamic threshold adjustment
- Warning system before locks
- Appeal process for false positives

**Status: ✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION**

The anti-spam system is fully implemented and tested. All components are integrated following the MVC-SR architecture with proper separation of concerns. The system is ready for deployment and use.
